                <p class="fst-italic">Trust me every other woman had it </p>
                <p>Acne is one of the symptomps of PCOS. Because of increase in androgen levels in body the acne problems arises. Typically the so called PCOS acne appear on chin and jaw line.

                <p class="fst-italic">Having Facial hair is normal</p>
                <p>If you are seeing hair on your cheek and above your eyebrows and you are thinking that you have pcos then I will say relax! every woman has more or less hair on face and it is a cause of concern when all of a sudden you are seeing it. Generally women with PCOS tend to grow hair on chest,jaw,back. There hair are harder than your other body hair and sometimes they are curly. Due to rise in levels of male hormones in your body you may experiece it. Grooming properly can help around this situation and also your doctor will suggest you hormonal pills to regulate your hormone levels in body.</p>

                <p class="fst-italic">There is no replacement for EXERCISE.</p>
                <p>Obesity and PCOS are interdependent i.e. obesity can cause PCOS and PCOS can cause obesity. But maintaining healthy weight is very much necessary and effective to control this condition. A slight wightloss can give you much relief and will help you to boost your confidence.Exercise is physical as well as an emotional remedy of PCOS.

                <p class="fst-italic">They will grow back</p>
                <p>Hair fall is like second common symptom of any health issue. Similarly as acne hairfall also does not signify that you have PCOS. The hairfall associated with PCOS is different than regular hairfall. Note that what PCOS does to you is it imbalences your hormones and hence your body tend to show male charecteristics like body hair,acne and men type baldness. PCOS patient tend to loose hair of crown area. So if your hairfall is majorly from crown area it may be a symptom of PCOS</p>

                <p>If left untreated PCOS can lead to infertility. Due to irregular ovulation or no ovulation women find it difficult to conceive and though conceived due to the hormonal imbalences there is a risk of miscarriage. Detected with PCOS doesn't mean that you can not have a baby but you will need medical help throughout your pregnecy. If you manage the symptomps and maintain a healthy lifestyle you can live a healthy life and have a healthy baby.</p>

              Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder common among women of reproductive age. Women with PCOS may have in frequent or prolonged menstrual periods or excess male hormone (androgen) levels. The ovaries may develop numerous small collections of fluid (follicles) and fail to regularly release eggs.This causes many problems like acne,hairfall from head, exessive body hair,infertility.PCOS affects more than 25% of Indian women who are of reproductive age, usually between the age of 14 and 40.

              Researchers and health care providers know that genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), but do not know exactly what causes PCOS.

              Because the symptoms of PCOS tend to run in families, the syndrome is probably caused, at least in part, by a change, or mutation, in one or more genes. Recent research conducted in animal models suggests that in some cases PCOS may be caused by genetic or chemical changes that occur in the womb.

              PCOS likely results from a combination of causes, including genes and environmental factors.

              No, not necessarily! Note that symptoms of PCOS resemble to many other health conditions sometimes they are cause of concern and sometimes they are not. It is always better to get yourself tested instead of making any false assumptions.For ex. acne, hairfall are very common problems and has like 1000 reasons for that.So always make sure that your disease is well detected.

              Type 2 diabetes is due to insufficient insulin production from beta cells in the setting of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance, which is the inability of cells to respond adequately to normal levels of insulin, occurs primarily within the muscles, liver, and fat tissue.This causes change in sugar level in blood, increased retention of salt and water by the kidneys, and inappropriate regulation of metabolism by the central nervous system.

              Ovarian follicles are small sacs filled with fluid that are found inside a woman’s ovaries. They secrete hormones which influence stages of the menstrual cycle and women begin puberty with about 300,000 to 400,000 of them. Each has the potential to release an egg for fertilisation. Follicles and their size and status are a vital part of assessing fertility and fertility treatment.

            Generally women gain weight due to PCOS. Having PCOS means that the body is not able to reduce insulin adequately. It converts into sugars and starches to extract energy. Because weight gain is characterized by male hormones it generally appears in the abdominal region of the body.

            PCOD stands for PolyCystic Ovarian Disease, while PCOS means PolyCystic Ovarian Syndrome. Although both of these health complications are of the human ovaries, which causes an imbalance in the hormonal system, they are different from each other through various aspects. Major differences between PCOD and PCOS are
            <ol>
              <li> Seriousness: PCOD is usually not treated as a disease because it can be cured with the proper exercise schedule and specific diet. At the same time, PCOS is a metabolic disorder that is a grave condition. </li>

              <li> Prevalence: PCOD is more prevalent than PCOS. One-third of the women of the world have PCOD. </li>

              <li> Complications: PCOS is more complicated than PCOD. Females suffering from PCOS are prone to develop cardiovascular issues, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, or even endometrial cancer. </li>

              <li> Visibility: The symptoms of PCOS are visible since the teenage years. Excessive body hairs, acne, and problems like weight gain are prominent from a young age only due to the disturbances in the overall metabolism.</li>

              <li> Fertility: Women suffering from PCOD do not show considerable fertility complications. A little medical help is needed for them to conceive. On the other hand, those with PCOS deal with infertility and miscarriages.</li>

              <li> Ovulation: Females with PCOD can ovulate normally over regular periods and can be pregnant without any problem. But the females suffering from PCOS cannot ovulate because of the disturbed hormonal secretion.</li>

            Thankfully, PCOS is managable, and women with PCOS can ovulate and get pregnant; you just might need a little extra help. It is important to remember that PCOS manifests differently depending on the person and that there's no one size fits all solution. What helps one woman manage her PCOS symptoms and get pregnant may not work for everyone. There are several options to help you start ovulating and get pregnant, and finding the one that works for you can take some time. The first recommendation most physicians give is to lose weight. This can be difficult because weight gain is a common symptom of PCOS. But, if you are overweight or obese, losing weight can help make your menstrual cycle more regular and improve fertility.

            PCOS cannot be treated and cured, and it even does not subside on its own. In many cases, PCOD has been treated completely, but there is always a chance of getting it back. The treatment procedures just include reducing the complications and treating the symptoms. Various options are available now. Depending upon the severity of the symptoms and the desire to get pregnant, a woman can choose one of the many options for her treatment. 
            <ol>
              <li> Lifestyle Changes: Specific diet, proper exercise, maintaining ideal body weight, etc., are recommended for a woman suffering from PCOD and PCOS. These all help in lowering insulin resistance. </li>
              <li> Weight Control: Reducing one's weight and maintaining an ideal body weight helps decrease testosterone, insulin, and luteinizing hormone (LH). </li>
              <li> Healthy Eating: Getting a proper well-balanced and PCOD/PCOS specific diet and regular exercise helps maintain hypertension and cholesterol. It also helps in treating sleeping disorders such as sleep apnea. </li>
              <li> Say NO to Alcohol and Cigarettes: Cutting down the consumption of alcohol and quitting cigarettes and other tobacco products are effective for lowering down the levels of androgens. </li>
              <li> Drugs and Medications: Doctors recommend a number of drugs and medications to treat diabetes and insulin resistance. Some drugs are also prescribed for encouraging the process of ovulation and the menstruation cycle to occur regularly. Retinoic acid and antibiotics are recommended for treating acne. Some doctors also prescribe oral contraceptive pills to help normalize the menstruation cycle. Certain hormonal medicines are also prescribed to check the level of androgen hormone. It must be noted that these medicines should always be taken by consulting a specialized doctor and not on our own.</li>

              <li> Self-Grooming: To remove the excess body and facial hair, many options such as shaving, waxing, electrolysis, depilatory, laser hair removal, etc., are available now. </li>

              <li> Homeopathy Or Ayurveda: Treating PCOD/PCOS with homeopathy or Ayurveda does not cure it completely. But it is an effective way to prevent further health complications. Homeopathic treatment is effective in regularizing ovulation, balancing the hormonal secretion, restoring the normal menstruation cycle, etc. Some homeopathy medicines also claim to dissolve the follicular cysts that eventually eliminate the need for all the other treatment procedures such as surgery or hormonal therapy.Ayurveda focuses on root cause of PCOS and manages it. Ayurveda doesn't focus much on symptomps but it helps to regulate menstrual cycle and as a consequence symptoms are also managed.Ayurveda, prescibed by experienced practitioner can give amazing results. </li>
